# SUSHI Lite plugin

This plugin provides the NISO SUSHI-Lite standard (2015 draft release) for PKP software.

## Requirements

* OJS 3.1 or a later release of OJS 3.x (for the 2.4.x version, see the ojs-dev-2_4 branch)
  * UsageStats plugin configured and enabled
  * For full standards compliance, disable_path_info should remain off
    * see: config.inc.php's general section and the disable_path_info directive for details.
* PHP 7.1 or later
  * libxml enabled

## Installation

Install this as a "generic" plugin in OJS.  The preferred installation method is through the Plugin Gallery.

To install manually via the filesystem, extract the contents of this archive this archive to a "sushiLite" directory under "plugins/generic" in your OJS root.  To install via Git submodule, target that same directory path: `git submodule add https://github.com/ulsdevteam/ojs-sushiLite-plugin plugins/generic/sushiLite`.  Run the installation script to register this plugin, e.g.: `php lib/pkp/tools/installPluginVersion.php plugins/generic/sushiLite/version.xml`

## Usage

The URI *{base_url}*/sushiLite/*{version}*/ will respond to the GetReport requests as documented in the the early draft [SUSHI-Lite proposal](http://groups.niso.org/apps/group_public/document.php?document_id=15331).  The currently supported SUSHI-Lite version is 1.7.  For example:
* Fetch the current AR1, reflecting the last month's usage, for any journal hosted on the site:
  * /ojs/index.php/index/sushiLite/v1_7/GetReport?Report=AR1
* Fetch the release 4.1 JR1 for all of 2015 for "myJournal":
  * /ojs/index.php/myJournal/sushiLite/v1_7/GetReport?Report=JR1&Release=4.1&BeginDate=2015-01-01&EndDate=2015-12-31

Your base URL and journal name will vary.
